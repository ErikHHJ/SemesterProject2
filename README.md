This site is a submission which was to be graded as the last task for the third semester. In this task, I was to create an auction page, with a provided API.
## Description
- BidScape is an auction page where users can register
- log in,
- view most recent auctions,
- scroll infinitely through auctions,
- posts with more than one image gain a carousel,
- view auctions with a close due date,
- search for auctions with a specific tag,
- create new posts,
- view their own profile with their credit,
- view auctions posted by any specific profile,
- view auctions won by any specific profile,
- and view other posters' profiles.
- delete auctions they have posted,
- edit auctions they have posted

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the people I surveyed for the user-testing. Their feedback and the replays from hotjar of their interaction with the website definitely improved the overall functionality and quality of the site. I have a tendency to overlook certain things, 
and its very difficult to imagine myself as a user of the site when coding it myself.
